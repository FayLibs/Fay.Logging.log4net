Fay Logging log4net
===========

What is it?
-----------

It is a [Fay Logging](https://github.com/FayLibs/Fay.Logging) facade for the log4net logging framework. This facade povides a simple delegate logging API making logging easier, while helping to make sure any of the code required to generate a log message is not executed unless the logging level is within scope.
